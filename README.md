# High Performance Computing
This repository contains HPC codes written in C.
1. Pagerank Algorithm is a search engine algorithm used by Google som time ago and named after Larry Page. The code is shared memory parallelized by using ***OpenMP***.
2. Image denoising is a physics equation, namely the heat equation applied to an image. The purpose is to smooth out random noise in the image. The algorithm is optimized by using distributed memory parallelization with ***MPI***.
