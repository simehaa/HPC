# IN3200
The whole purpose of this repository is to save the programs which are the weekly exercises in the course IN3200, spring 2019. The folders set1, set2, etc. contain my own implementations.
The folder **C_examples** will contain (hopefully) many examples which demonstrate how to perform the most important coding skills in the **C** language. I.e. :
* fileread (binary and text)
* memory allocation
* how to use 3D arrays
... and really all the functions I would like to use as a look-up reference for myself, but feel free to use my codes.
